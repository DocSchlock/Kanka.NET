# This project is under heavy development at the moment and is not ready for use
# This project is not affliated with Kanka in any capacity.

## Hey! What is this?

Kanka.NET is a .NET 6 Library wrapping the Kanka.io API.

Eventually, all features of the API will be supported in code, and this project will be released as a Nuget.

## What can I do with this?

Any action the API allows a user to take, you will be able to do with Kanka.NET.

## What's the status?

We just started development recently and are working on getting the core architecture up and running. GET functionality will be available soon for all endpoints.
